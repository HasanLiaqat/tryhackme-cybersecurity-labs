# 🛡️ Defensive Security: Blue Team Fundamentals

**Date Completed:** 3 December 2025

**Room/Module:** Defensive Security Intro

### Objective Achieved
I successfully completed a hands-on investigation of a simulated **Web Discovery Attack** on the FakeBank network. This task provided practical experience in initial threat detection and immediate containment using defensive security tooling.

### Key Concepts Covered
* **Defence in Depth:** Understanding the necessity of layered security controls (like firewalls, IDS, and policies) to prevent a single point of failure.
* **Security Operations Centre (SOC):** Learned about the central hub of defensive security, which operates 24/7/365 to monitor and protect the organization.
* **Key Defensive Roles:** Explored the responsibilities of professionals like **SOC Analysts** (for monitoring) and **Incident Responders** (for managing live threats).
* **SIEM Technology:** Understood the role of Security Information and Event Management systems as the central tool for collecting and analyzing security logs.
* **Containment:** Practiced the critical Incident Response step of blocking malicious activity to limit the scope of an attack.

### Practical Steps Taken
1. **Identification:** Used the simulated SIEM dashboard to identify and triage the security alert for a Web Discovery Attack.
2. **Analysis:** Extracted the malicious source IP address and reviewed the suspicious commands/payloads being executed by the attacker.
3. **Containment:** Utilized the Firewall interface to implement a rule that successfully **blocked** the attacker's source IP address from accessing the network.
