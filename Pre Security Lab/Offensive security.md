## TryHackMe: Bank Hacking Simulation



**Date Completed:** 2 December 2025

**Room/Module:** Introduction to Offensive Security



### Objective Achieved

I successfully exploited a vulnerability in a simulated bank application (**FakeBank**) to transfer funds to a target account. This task introduced me to fundamental concepts of Web Application Security.



### Key Concepts Covered

* **Ethical Hacking:** Understanding how attackers find and exploit vulnerabilities.

* **Web Application Flaws:** I learned about a specific vulnerability (likely an unauthorized access or parameter manipulation flaw) that allowed me to bypass security controls.

* **Simulated Environment:** Gained practical experience interacting with a controlled, vulnerable system.



### Practical Steps Taken

1.  **Discovery:** Located a hidden or unprotected page (e.g., `/b**k-t****er`) used for fund transfers.

2.  **Exploitation:** Manipulated the request parameters (account number and amount) to successfully execute a transfer to the target account (8881).

3.  **Validation:** Confirmed the successful hack by observing the change in the account balance and retrieving the flag.



**Flag Found:** `B**K-H******`

## Next Steps

* Plan to move on to the **Defensive Security** room to strengthen my base skills.
