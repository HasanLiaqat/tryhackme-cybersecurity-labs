# 🌐 Networking Fundamentals: What is Network?

**Date Completed:** 6 December 2025

**Room/Module:** What is Network?

**Focus:** Establishing a foundational understanding of computer networks, the Internet, and how devices communicate.

---

### Objective Achieved
I completed the first room in the Networking Fundamentals path, gaining clarity on basic networking concepts, the structure of the Internet, device identification, and the use of the fundamental network tool, `ping`.

### Key Concepts Covered
* **What is Networking?** Networking is the practice of linking two or more computing devices together to share data, resources, and services.
* **The Internet:** The Internet is a global network of computer networks. It relies on a standardized set of rules (**Protocols**) to facilitate communication between devices globally.
* **Device Identification:** Devices on a network are uniquely identified using several methods:
    * **IP Address:** A logical address used for routing traffic across different networks (e.g., $192.168.1.1$).
    * **MAC Address:** A physical, unique hardware identifier assigned to a network interface card (NIC) by the manufacturer.
* **Routers and Switches:** These are key devices that direct network traffic. **Routers** handle traffic between different networks, and **Switches** handle traffic within a single network.
* **Ping (ICMP):** Learned about the **I**nternet **C**ontrol **M**essage **P**rotocol and the `ping` command, which is used to test the reachability and measure the round-trip time (latency) to another host on an IP network.

### Practical Steps Taken
1. **Conceptual Learning:** Studied the basic definitions of networks and the layered structure of the Internet.
2. **Identification Practice:** Understood the difference and role of both IP and MAC addresses in network communication.
3. **Tool Familiarization:** Practiced or learned about the practical use of the `ping` command to test connectivity to a target host.

## Next Steps
* I will continue with the Networking Fundamentals path, moving on to more complex topics like understanding the DNS.
