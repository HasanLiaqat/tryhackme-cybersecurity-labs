# 💼 Cyber Security Jobs: Exploring Career Roles

**Date Completed:** 4 December 2025

**Room/Module:** Cyber Security Jobs

**Focus:** Gaining an understanding of the diverse roles and responsibilities within the cybersecurity industry (both defensive and offensive).

---

### Objective Achieved
I explored seven distinct career paths within cybersecurity, understanding the primary function, required skills, and key tools for each role. This provided a clear overview of how different teams contribute to an organization's security posture.

### Key Concepts Covered
* **Blue Team (Defensive) Roles:** Focus on protecting systems, detecting threats, and responding to incidents.
    * **Security Analyst:** Daily monitoring of security tools (like SIEM) to identify and triage threats.
    * **Security Engineer:** Designs, builds, and maintains the security infrastructure and tools.
    * **Incident Responder:** Manages the full lifecycle of a security breach, from containment to recovery.
    * **Digital Forensics Examiner:** Collects, preserves, and analyzes digital evidence post-incident for legal or technical purposes.
    * **Malware Analyst:** Investigates malicious software (malware) to understand its capabilities, origin, and impact.

* **Red Team (Offensive) Roles:** Focus on simulating attacks to find vulnerabilities before adversaries do.
    * **Penetration Tester:** Conducts authorized ethical hacks against systems to uncover security flaws.
    * **Red Teamer:** Conducts a more comprehensive, goal-based simulation of a real-world threat actor over an extended period.

* **Essential Skills:** Understanding that a core knowledge of networking, operating systems (Linux/Windows), and scripting (Python) is crucial across nearly all roles.

### Practical Steps Taken
1. **Research:** Studied the day-to-day tasks, required education, and skill sets for each of the seven roles.
2. **Analysis:** Categorized each role into its respective team (Blue or Red) to understand its contribution to the overall security strategy.
3. **Assessment:** Completed the room's quiz to test retention of the primary duties associated with each job title.

## Next Steps
* Now that I understand the roles, I plan to move on to room of **Networking Fundamentals** to build a crucial foundation.
